# Jerk car
This is an example of a 4 dimensional state estimated via a Vanilla Kalman filter, and writing the estimate and covariance to a CSV file.

This example also shows how straight forward it is to use this package.

*Note*: this example comes from the second midterm of Dr. Ahmed's ASEN 5044 at CU Boulder.

# Example graph
This plot uses the data from `temp.csv`, so feel free to inspect that.

Note that the position is not correctly estimated.
